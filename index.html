    <h1>  Fire & Ice </h1>
    
    <p>
    Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.<br>
From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who<br> favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know <br>enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great
And would suffice.
